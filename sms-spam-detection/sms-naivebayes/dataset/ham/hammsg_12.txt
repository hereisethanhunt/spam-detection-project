Is  Fuel  Really Costly? GO AHEAD, READ ON.. I filled up my vehicle's fuel tank, and I thght fuel has become really expensive . But whn I compared it with other  liquids nd with some calculations , I felt a little better. Here r d results below.. Petrol : Rs. 64.97 per litre.. Coca Cola 330ml can : Rs.25 i.e. Rs.76 per litre.. Nariyal paani  200ml Rs.25 i.e. Rs. 125 per litre.. Pantene conditioner 400ml Rs.165 i.e. Rs.413 per litre.. Parachute oil 100ml Rs21 i.e. Rs210.00 per litre.. n dis is d REAL KICKER Lexmark inkjet color ink cartridge  21ml Rs.950 i.e. Rs.45238 per litre..!! So think before u say anythng...... So don't curse  Petrol  rates ? b glad ur byk/car doesn't run on ink cartridge, coke, hair oil etc..:-):-D;-) JAO AUR PETROL PHUKOO..!! :)

If you have food in your fridge, clothes on your rack, a roof over your head, and a place to sleep, You are richer than 75% of the entire world... If you have money in your wallet, a little change and can go anywhere you want, You are among the top 8% of the worlds wealthy... If you woke up this morning with more health than illness, You are more blessed than the million people who wont survive this week and die... If you can actually READ this message and understand it, You are more fortunate than the 3 Billion people in the world who cannot see, dont know english, or suffer being mentally retarded... Life is not about stupid exams, silly girl/guy who dumped you, or whatever else that does not matter at all... Its all about a thousand other reasons to be happy & live this precious life happily, which itself is a gift!!

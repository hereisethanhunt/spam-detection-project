IF ONLY YOU WOULD'VE TALKED TO ME, I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO WRITE THIS... that conversation lasted 00:00:26 seconds. i don't understand what requires so much of your attention that you can't even spare 2 minutes on the phone with me. especially when at the end of everyday, all you seem to have done is nothing much!!! and guess what, a guy who gets all excited and dressed up just because a girl will be working in the same lab is called a nerd, not awesome!!!

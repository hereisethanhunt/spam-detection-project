If a man slaps a woman, he is called a ruscal, if he is slapped by woman, he is called coward. If he likes to spend more time outside he is called awara; if he likes to live home more time, he is called a homesick. If he rebukes his children, he is called a Ravaan or he do otherwise then he is called a weak personality. If he do not give his wife/gf to work, he is a narrow framed person, if he do otherwise he is called a person who earns livelihood after his wife/gf.Moral of story, what a pity, what a real man do!!!!

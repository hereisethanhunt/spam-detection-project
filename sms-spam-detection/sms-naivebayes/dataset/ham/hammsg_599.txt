I realised that somethings in life hurt more than words can ever express.. When the people you hold so high suddenly make you feel so small.. When the best of your friends laugh at you when you had expected them to support you.. When the most special person in your life makes you feel so unwanted.. When the people you cant live without tell you they dont need you anymore.. When the people who have always been a part of your prayers dont even want to hear your name.. When people who had once listened to everything you say suddenly declare that they dont understand you anymore.. It is rightly said 'only the wearer knows where the shoe bites'.

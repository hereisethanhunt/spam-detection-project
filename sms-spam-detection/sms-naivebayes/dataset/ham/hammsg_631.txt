I may be a person not of much importance to you . . . I may not be the person who can make you happy the way others make you . . . I may not have a place for myself in your scroll . . . But I know that I am something better than nothing . . . Friend is my common name . . . Its your wish to prefix me with close, best, good, bad, fake or worst . . . Whatever it may be- I'm happy that you call me a 'FRIEND' -a word that throws light in my life...!!

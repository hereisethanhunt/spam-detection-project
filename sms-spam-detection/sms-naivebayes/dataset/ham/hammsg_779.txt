I hope maybe someday in future, when its raining outside and you are sitting near a window, deep in thought,a memory about the time we shared together drifts through your mind and a beautiful tear falls down from your eyes, you smile thinking about me. And believe me, that day i will be the happiest person on earth not because i made you smile but because i was worth your tears.Pass dis 2ur friends whom u nvr wanna lose...
